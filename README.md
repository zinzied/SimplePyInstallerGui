##  Overview

PyInstaller GUI is a user-friendly graphical interface designed to simplify the process of converting Python scripts (`.py` files) into standalone executable files (`.exe`). Built using PyQt6, this application provides an intuitive interface for configuring PyInstaller options, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features

- **File Selection**: Easily select the Python script you want to convert.
- **Output Directory**: Choose where to save the generated executable.
- **Output Format**: Select between a single executable file (`onefile`) or a directory (`onedir`).
- **Window Option**: Decide whether the application should run with a console or as a windowed application.
- **Icon File**: Optionally add a custom icon to your executable.
- **Hidden Imports**: ðŸš€ Automatically detect and add missing modules during the conversion process ðŸš€. (NEW FEATURES)
- **Additional Files and Directories**: Include extra files and directories in your executable.
- **Progress Bar**: Monitor the conversion progress in real-time.
- **Threading**: Perform conversions in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
